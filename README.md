# Course Appointment Scheduling System

## Introduction
The CSMC (Computer Science Mentor Center) currently handles various activities, such as mentor scheduling, 
student registration for sessions, communication with instructors about pertinent information, and so on. 
A supportive software system was developed to help users perform most of these activities – the CSMC Website. 
However, the development of the website had multiple iterations, each with a different developer team, 
which lead to different implementation decisions regarding languages, frameworks, etc. 

- Purpose <br/>
The purpose of this document is to describe a new project proposal, the CSMC Website Renewal, which aims to solve (or at least alleviate) some of the issues aforementioned. 
In addition, the project will give CS and SE students (graduate level) the opportunity to benefit from the experience of working in a real project, 
from planning to deployment, with “real” clients, needs, and requirements. 

- Scope <br/>
Computer Science Mentor Center helps students with review of classes, the website used for this is developed on PHP for backend and Twig for frontend. 
In this project the backend would be transformed to Spring Boot Java, to make it a maintainable code and document these for future purpose. 
This would help the future developers joining CSMC to understand the code easily and make new updates.
